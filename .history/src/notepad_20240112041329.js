    - could create a hook 
        - which returns an object 
            - where each field points to 
                - a list of all items (array)
                - and then a list of checked items (set)
        - what do you pass to custom hook?
    - don't need to create a custom hook
    - if done so, json result can just return data instead of an object with x number of properties
